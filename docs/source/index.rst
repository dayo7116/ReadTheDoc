Welcome to MT CloudXR's documentation!
======================================

**MT CloudXR SDK** is a GPU-accelerated virtual reality (VR)/augmented reality (AR) streaming platform that was built to stream OpenVR-based applications from a remote server. 
Using CloudXR, VR/AR content can be streamed over ethernet, Wi-Fi, cellular, and other standard networking technologies.

.. note::

   The CloudXR client SDK library supports Microsoft Windows and Android devices.


XR content is streamed from a Windows server to an XR client device, which provides access to a high-powered graphics server from a relatively low-end client. Examples of VR clients are an PICO headset that is connected to a laptop or all-in-one headsets, such as the PICO NEO 3 and PICO 4.

The MT CloudXR SDK comprises a server driver, the client SDK, and sample client applications.
